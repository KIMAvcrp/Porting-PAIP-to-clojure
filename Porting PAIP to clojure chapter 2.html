<p>   This is the first post of my series porting PAIP to clojure.
   It is possible to follow my post even if you don't have a copy of PAIP but I strongly recommend that you get a copy
   of it.
   This chapter contains a program to generate random sentences using a grammar for a subset of english.
   Norvig presents two versions of the program, a straightforward solution using functions to represent grammar
   rules. Then the weaknesses of this approach are shown and a better solution is developed using a rule-based solution.
   Afterwards, the advantages of the rule-based approach are discussed.
   This is a example of the typical pattern of the book: the examples are not presentet in there final form but are
   iteratively developed. This makes PAIP one of the best programming books out there.

     A rule consists either of two or more non-terminals like Noun-phrase or of a collection of terminals like the, a,&hellip;
     This representation is very natural if you have ever worked with context-free grammars before.
     The rule Article =&gt; the, a, &hellip;  means: An article is either the or a or &hellip; (Article = the | a | &hellip;)

<p>    That is the Common Lisp code. It can be found <a href="http://norvig.com/paip/README.html">here</a>.
</p>


<pre class="example">(defun sentence ()    (append (noun-phrase) (verb-phrase)))
(defun noun-phrase () (append (Article) (Noun)))
(defun verb-phrase () (append (Verb) (noun-phrase)))
(defun Article ()     (one-of '(the a)))
(defun Noun ()        (one-of '(man ball woman table)))
(defun Verb ()        (one-of '(hit took saw liked)))
</pre>

<p>
    The translation to clojure is straightforward. But I will use a slightly modified version which is, as I think,
    a little bot more ideomatic in clojure:
</p>


<pre class="example">(declare sentence noun-phrase verb-phrase article noun verb one-of)

(defn  sentence [] (concat (noun-phrase) (verb-phrase)))
(defn  noun-phrase [] (concat (article) (noun)))
(defn  verb-phrase [] (concat (verb) (noun-phrase)))
(defn  article [] (one-of ["the" "a"]))
(defn  noun [] (one-of ["man" "ball" "woman" "table"]))
(defn  verb [] (one-of ["hit" "took" "saw" "liked"]))
</pre>

<p>
    I use vectors to represent collections and strings instead of symbols. here are the helper-functions:
    one-of picks one element of the collection and returns a single-element collection containing it.
</p>


<pre class="example">(defn one-of [coll]
  (if (seq coll)
   [(rand-nth coll)]))
</pre>

<p>
    To test, lets get 10 random sentences
</p>


<pre class="example">(take 10 (repeatedly sentence))   
</pre>

<p>
    this evaluates to:
</p>


<pre class="example">(("a" "ball" "liked" "the" "ball")
("the" "table" "took" "the" "ball")
("the" "man" "took" "a" "man")
("the" "woman" "saw" "a" "man")
("a" "ball" "hit" "the" "ball")
("a" "table" "hit" "the" "man")
("a" "ball" "took" "a" "ball")
("a" "man" "liked" "a" "ball")
("a" "table" "saw" "the" "ball")
("the" "woman" "hit" "a" "ball"))
</pre>

<p>
    I believe it is apparent that this is not a good representation for a grammar. The lisp functions are definitly
    harder to read than the normal grammar syntax shown above.
    If you wanted to represent the following rule:
    Adj* =&gt; e,Adj + Adj*
    (note that e is the empty symbol)
    you would have to write a function like this:
</p>


<pre class="example">(declare Adj)
(defn Adj* []
  (if (= (rand-int 2) 0)
    nil
    (concat (Adj) (Adj*))))
</pre>

<p>
    There has to be a better way&hellip; enter the data-driven solution!
</p></div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> A data-driven solution</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">

<p>   The naive solution is straightforward to implement while making it harder to encode the grammar rules.
   By using a data-driven approach, it is the other war round. Writing grammar rules becomes easy while implementation
   may become harder. So let's take a look how the data-driven solution works for this problem.
   The first step is to decouple the grammar from the code which processes it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-3-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.1</span> The representation of the grammar</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-1">

<p>    In the book Norvig represents the grammar with the following datastructure:
</p>


<pre class="example"> (defparameter *simple-grammar*
 '((sentence -&gt; (noun-phrase verb-phrase))
  (noun-phrase -&gt; (Article Noun))
  (verb-phrase -&gt; (Verb noun-phrase))
  (Article -&gt; the a)
  (Noun -&gt; man ball woman table)
   (Verb -&gt; hit took saw liked))
"A grammar for a trivial subset of English.")
</pre>

<p>
    Here the grammar rule sentence =&gt; noun-phrase + verb<sub>phrase</sub> gets translated to (sentence -&gt; (noun-phrase verb-phrase))
    So a list of elements means "produce this nonterminals in sequence". Multiple nonterminals right of the -&gt; sign mean
    "choose one of this nonterminals". Every rule is itself a list and the grammar is a list of rules.
    This is a good showcase of the power of lisps to write internal DSLs btw.
</p>
<p>
    But this representation is not really clojureish?.
    We can take advantage of clojures literal representation for maps,vectors and sets in addition to lists. With this, the
    meaning of a datastructure- when choosen appropriate- becomes more clear. Let me give you an example:
    What are grammar rules? Rules map a nonterminal to - posible multiple - nonterminals or terminals. Thus it is appropriate
    to represent them as a map in clojure. I choose to represent the nonterminals as keywords and the values of the map as
    either one element or a vector of multiple elements. A vector means: "apply all elements in order".
    Norvig represents a choice of nonterminals as simply the nonterminals written after the -&gt; sign.
    For me, it was not clear at the beginning that that means "choose one of these nonterminals".
    In clojure, it is natural represent this with a set!
    Rewritten, the grammar becomes the following:
</p>


<pre class="example"> (def simple-grammar
{:sentence [:noun-phrase :verb-phrase]
 :noun-phrase [:Article :Noun]
 :verb-phrase [:Verb :noun-phrase]
 :Article #{"the" "a"}
 :Noun #{"man" "ball" "woman" "table"}
 :Verb #{"hit" "took" "saw" "liked"}})

 (def ^:dynamic *grammar* simple-grammar)
</pre>

<p>
    Ok that's for the design part. Now that we have a good representation of our data, the grammar, we have to worry
    about evaluating it.
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-3-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.2</span> Evaluating the grammar</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-2">

<p>    Because I choose a different and more ideomatic representation of the grammar in clojure, the code for evaluating
    the grammar will obviosly be different than the code in PAIP. So I won't literatly translate the code here, but
    instead post the code to evaluate my representation of the grammar.
</p>
<p>    
    So, how can we generate a possible sentence: 
    the function 'generate' will take the startsymbol as argument and retrieves the rule from the grammar.
    If there is not a rule for the argument in the grammar, the argument itself is evaluated (thus making it possible
    to call generate either with the left hand or the right hand side of a rule).
    It will work the elements of the rule in sequence, appending the result as it goes along. When it encounters
    a set, it will generate one random element of it. When it encounters a nonterminal - (which is itself element of the grammar(),
    it recursively generates the nonterminal. If it encounters a terminal, that is none of the above are true it just
    returns an single-element vector of it.
</p>


<pre class="example">(defn generate [phrase]
    (cond (get *grammar* phrase) (generate (get *grammar* phrase))
          (sequential? phrase) (mapcat generate phrase)
          (set? phrase)  (generate (rand-nth (seq phrase)))
          :else [phrase]))
</pre>

<p>
    Amazing how closely the code mimics the description.
    The book states that this is called data-driven programming and that it has the advantage to be able to change the
    data without having to modify the original program.
</p>
<p>
    So now we have code to evaluate the grammar. Let's take a look at a more complicated example and see how the
    data-driven approach scales. Here's the bigger grammar:
</p>


<pre class="example">(def ^:dynamic *bigger-grammar*
'{:sentence [:noun-phrase :verb-phrase]
  :noun-phrase #{[:Article :Adj* :Noun :PP*] :Name :Pronoun}
  :verb-phrase [:Verb :noun-phrase :PP*]
  :PP* #{[] [:PP :PP*]}
  :Adj* #{[] [:Adj :Adj*]}
  :PP [:Prep :noun-phrase]
  :Prep #{"to" "in" "by" "with" "on"}
  :Adj #{"big" "little" "blue" "green" "adiabatic"}
  :Article #{"the" "a"}
  :Name #{"Pat" "Kim" "Lee" "Terry" "Robin"}
  :Noun #{"man" "ball" "woman" "table"}
  :Verb #{"hit" "took" "saw" "liked"}
  :Pronoun #{"he" "she" "it" "these" "those" "that"}
 })
(def ^:dynamic *grammar* *bigger-grammar*)
</pre>

<p>
    Let's generate 10 sentences again:
</p>


<pre class="example">(take 10 (repeatedly #(generate :sentence)))

(("these" "liked" "a" "ball")
 ("a" "ball" "in" "the" "big" "green" "big" "woman" "in" "that" "by" "Terry" "liked" "a" "man")
 ("that" "liked" "that")
 ("Lee" "hit" "it")
 ("Lee" "took" "Lee")
 ("the" "little" "blue" "little" "ball" "in" "Terry" "by" "Robin" "liked" "Pat")
 ("a" "adiabatic" "blue" "blue" "ball" "saw" "the" "man" "in" "Pat" "by" "Lee" "on" "a" "adiabatic" "table" "in" "Terry")
 ("Pat" "hit" "Robin" "to" "those")
 ("those" "liked" "the" "woman" "with" "Robin" "with" "these" "in" "the" "table" "to" "Robin" "to" "a" "blue" "adiabatic" "ball" "with" "she" "on" "those" "on" "those")
 ("it" "hit" "Kim" "on" "she" "on" "the" "table"))
</pre>

<p>
    It works! Enjoy the funny sentences.
    But hey,I want to see how the sentences are generated, I want to see the parse-tree.
    Because of the data-driven design, it is easy to implement this. The data doesn't need to be changed, we need
    only a new evaluation-function. 
</p>


<pre class="example">(defn generate-all [phrase]
  (let [rule phrase]
    (cond (sequential? rule) (mapcat generate-all rule)
          (set? rule)  (generate-all (rand-nth (seq rule)))
          (get *grammar* phrase)  (list phrase (generate-all (get *grammar* phrase)))
          :else phrase)))

(generate-all :sentence)
;=&gt;
    (:sentence 
      (:noun-phrase 
         (:Name "Kim")
       :verb-phrase 
         (:Verb "saw"
          :noun-phrase 
            (:Article "the"
             :Adj* 
               (:Adj "adiabatic" 
                :Adj* ())
             :Noun "ball" 
             :PP* ())
          :PP* ())))
</pre>


<p>    
   Norvig gives a last example of a generate-all function which works on the smple grammar and returns all possible
   sentences defined by the grammar (the language of the grammar). I leaf the implementation to the reader :)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">

<p>   Gratulations for making it through the post.
   With this chapter, Norvig makes a strong point which will be even more important in the next chapters ( and is
   for programming in general)
   If you use the data-driven approach, you use "the most natural notation available to solve the problem".
   So instead of worrying how to implement the problem, worry about how to represent you data, so that it is easy
   to understand and to scale it.
   With the data-driven solution, you can
</p><ul>
<li>expand and modify the program easier
</li>
<li>use different datasets with the same evaluation function
</li>
<li>use different evaluation functions with the same dataset
</li>
<li>represent your problem so that it is easier to understand.
