* PAIP to clojure - chapter 4
  I continue to translate PAIP to clojure. This chapter covers the GPS program, the
  General Problem Solver. As ever, the focus lies on the iterative process of developing
  an (ai-) progam. Norvig presents 5 stages of an programming project, after which the
  sections of the chapter are numbered:
  1. Describe
  2. Specify (in algorithmic terms) 
  3. Implement                     
  4. Test                            
  5. Debug/Analyse (optional repeat)
** 1. Description
   GPS was the first program, which separated its problem-solving strategy from its knowledge of particular
   problems. As problem-solving strategy it used [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means-ends_analysis][means-ends analysis]]. In means-ends analysis you know in what
   state you are right now and in what state you will be when you have solved your problem. The focus lies
   on what is between your state now and the goal-state and how this distance can be overcome.
   An Example:
   I have to write an email. What Do I need to do to write an-email ? I have to type. What do I need to type?
   I have to sit in front of my pc ? What do I need to do to sit in front of my pc ? Go to the PC ....

   It is obvious that we have to be able to answer "What do I need to  ... "or, like the book points out "What is the
   difference between..." from the set of all possible actions. And each actions could have itself preconditions,
   for  which actions have to be taken befor this action can be taken.
   So this is the shortform of the description, see PAIP for the full discussion.
** 2. Specification
   After having a (rough) Idea of how the means-ends analysis works, it is time to come to the second step: Specification
   In this stage, we refine the description to something that is representible in the implementation language.
   This also gives the starting point for the implementation. And it greatly  influences the design part.
   I tink the stage of Specification is best defined with:
   Find the most natural mapping between the problem and the implementation language!
   So let's see how means-ends analysis can be represented in clojure:
    - A state can be represented as a set of conditions, so as #{unknown poor} and #{rich famous}. We need 2 states:
     the current state and the goal state (which of the two above is the goal-state...?)
    - The allowable actions can naturally be represented as a collection of actions, which can be worked in 
      order to find the first, that is applicable
    - An  needs a Name, a descriptions of what states a person has to be in in order to take the action and
      a description what states of the person will change after taking the action. 
      An action can therefor be described by a map (or later by a record) with a :name and a :precond field. 
      The changes of the state of the acting person are trickier. Consider an action "Become rich" has as precond
      being poor and changes that to being rich. It could also remove states or add new ones. The change of one 
      state to the other can easily be represented in terms of removing the old one and adding the new one.
      Thus the Action will have two more fields, a :del-list and a :add-list which contains states which will 
      be added or removed from the person who takes the action.
    - Last, but not least, we have to specify the entry point of the application, the GPS-function.
      We need a start-state, a goal-state and the allowed actions. Thus it can be represented as a three argument
      pure function (or as a two argument function which depends on a dynamic rebindable *list-of-ops* var, but for
      cosistency with the book I will go with the pure function).
   
  Now we have specified the single entities of the program. The algorithm is next to go:
  GPS succeeds if it can achieve all single conditions in the goal state by applying a sequence of actions.
  To decide wheter to apply an action or not, we have to look in its add list. If a goal-condition is in the
  add-list the action is appropriate and GPS wants to take the action. It can take the action if it can achieve
  all preconds of the action, which is just calling itself with the preconds as goal-state. If was able to
  achieve every condition of the goal state, it succeedes.
  (Note that this is the first, most simplest specification, it will be refined in the later sections)
  Ok, this is enough for the first implementation of the program!
** 3. Implementation
